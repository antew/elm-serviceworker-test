# Elm Service Worker Test
This is a demo of a service worker responding to a HTTP GET request from `elm/http`

1. Run `npm start`
2. Load the page and after 1 seconds you should see the text change from `Ping` to `Pong`, the response from the service worker.
3. If it says "Error" instead refresh and it should work on the second time
